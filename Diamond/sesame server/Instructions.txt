How do you map the triples in Sesame repository to deferencable uris?

http://localhost:8080/openrdf-workbench/repositories/InMemory01/explore?resource=%3Chttp%3A%2F%2Fwww4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de%2Fbizer%2Fbsbm%2Fv01%2Finstances%2FProductType1%3E

map to http://localhost:8080/bsbm/instances/ProductType1 ?

So assume you have Apache Tomcat running.

Use Pubby. Download it from here:
http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/pubby/

Once you download it, one of the folders you will see is "webapp". Rename that to bsbm and put that in the webapp folder in Tomcat.

In the new bsbm folder, you will see a WEB-INF/config.n3 file. Replace it with the one I am attaching. Open the new config.n3 and put in the correct sparql endpoint. I have http://localhost:8080/openrdf-sesame/repositories/bsbm. Replace it with what you have on your local machine.
